            The early years:
        </h3>

        <p>
                Elon Reeve Musk was born on June 28, 1971, in Pretoria, Transvaal, South Africa. 
            His mother is Maye Musk, a model and dietitian born in Saskatchewan, Canada, but raised in 
            South Africa. His father is Errol Musk, a South African electromechanical engineer, pilot, 
            sailor, consultant and property developer. He has a younger brother who was an early business 
            partner of his, Kimbal (born 1972), and a younger sister, Tosca (born 1974), the CEO of the 
            video streaming site Passionflix. His maternal grandfather, Dr. Joshua Haldeman, was an 
            American-born Canadian. His paternal grandmother had both British and Pennsylvania Dutch ancestry.
            After his parents divorced in 1980, Musk lived mostly with his father in the suburbs of Pretoria, 
            a choice he made two years after his parents separated but which he subsequently regretted.

        <p>
                While awaiting Canadian documentation, Musk attended the University of Pretoria for 
            five months. Once in Canada, Musk entered Queen's University in 1989, avoiding mandatory 
            service in the South African military. He left in 1992 to study economics and physics at 
            the University of Pennsylvania; he graduated in 1997 with a Bachelor of Science degree in 
            economics from the Wharton School and a Bachelor of Arts degree in physics from the College 
            of Arts and Sciences.
            In 1994, Musk held two internships in Silicon Valley during the summer: 
            at an energy storage start-up called Pinnacle Research Institute, which researched 
            electrolytic ultracapacitors for energy storage, and at the Palo Alto-based start-up 
            Rocket Science Games. Bruce Leak, the former lead engineer behind Apple's QuickTime who 
            had hired Musk, noted: "He had boundless energy. Kids these days have no idea about hardware 
            or how stuff works, but he had a PC hacker background and was not afraid to just go figure 
            things out."

        <p> 
                In March 1999, Musk co-founded X.com, an online financial services and e-mail payment 
            company, with US$10 million from the sale of Zip2. One year later, the company merged 
            with Confinity, which had a money-transfer service called PayPal. The merged company 
            focused on the PayPal service and was renamed PayPal in 2001. Musk was ousted in October 
            2000 from his role as CEO (although he remained on the board) due to disagreements with 
            other company executives over his desire to move PayPal's Unix-based infrastructure to a 
            Microsoft one. In October 2002, PayPal was acquired by eBay for US$1.5 billion in stock, 
            of which Musk received US$165 million. Before its sale, Musk, who was the company's largest 
            shareholder, owned 11.7% of PayPal's shares.

        <p>
                In 2001, Musk conceived Mars Oasis, an idea to land a miniature experimental 
            greenhouse on Mars, containing food crops growing on Martian regolith, in an attempt 
            to reawaken public interest in space exploration. In October 2001, Musk traveled to Moscow 
            with Jim Cantrell (an aerospace supplies fixer), and Adeo Ressi (his best friend from college), 
            to buy refurbished DneprIntercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) that could send the envisioned 
            payloads into space. The group met with companies such as NPO Lavochkin and Kosmotras; however, 
            according to Cantrell, Musk was seen as a novice and was consequently spat on by one of the Russian 
            chief designers. The group returned to the United States empty-handed. In February 2002, the group 
            returned to Russia to look for three ICBMs, bringing along Mike Griffin. Griffin had worked for the 
            CIA's venture capital arm, In-Q-Tel, as well as NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and was just leaving 
            Orbital Sciences, a maker of satellites and spacecraft. The group had another meeting with Kosmotras 
            and were offered one rocket for US$8 million. Musk considered the price too high, and stormed out of 
            the meeting. On the flight back from Moscow, Musk realized that he could start a company that could 
            build the affordable rockets he needed. Ultimately, Musk founded SpaceX with the long-term goal of 
            creating a true spacefaring civilization.
            With US$100 million of his early fortune, Musk founded Space Exploration Technologies Corp., 
            traded as SpaceX, in May 2002. Musk is CEO and CTO of the Hawthorne, California-based company. 
            By 2016, Musk's private trust held 54% of SpaceX stock, equivalent to 78% of voting shares.

        <h3 id="neuralink">
            Neuralink:
        </h3>
        <p>
                In 2016, Musk co-founded Neuralink, a neurotechnology start-up company to integrate 
            the human brain with artificial intelligence. The company is centered on creating devices 
            that can be implanted in the human brain, with the eventual purpose of helping human beings 
            merge with software and keep pace with advancements in artificial intelligence. These 
            enhancements could improve memory or allow more direct interfacing with computing devices.
            Musk sees Neuralink and OpenAI as related: "OpenAI is a nonprofit dedicated to minimizing the 
            dangers of artificial intelligence, while Neuralink is working on ways to implant technology 
            into our brains to create mind-computer interfaces."
            At a live demonstration in August 2020, Musk described one of their early devices as "a Fitbit 
            in your skull" which could soon cure paralysis, deafness, blindness, and other disabilities. 
            Many neuroscientists and publications criticized these claims. For example, MIT Technology 
            Review described them as "highly speculative" and "neuroscience theater".

    <div>
        <h3 id="theBoringCompany">
            The Boring Company:
        </h3>
        <p>
                On December 17, 2016, while stuck in traffic, Musk tweeted "[I] am going to build a tunnel 
            boring machine and just start digging ..." The company was named 'The Boring Company' (TBC). 
            On January 21, 2017, Musk tweeted "Exciting progress on the tunnel front. Plan to start digging 
            in a month or so." Discussions with regulatory bodies began in January 2017.
            In February 2017, the company began digging a 30-foot (9.1 m) wide, 50-foot (15 m) long, and 
            15-foot (4.6 m) deep "test trench" on the premises of Space X's offices in Los Angeles, since 
            the construction requires no permits. Musk had said in early 2017 that a 10-fold decrease in 
            tunnel boring cost per mile is necessary for economic feasibility of the proposed tunnel network. 
            According to Tesla and SpaceX board member Steve Jurvetson, the tunnel width is optimized for 
            electric vehicles only, which avoids complications of exhaust venting with internal combustion 
            engines.
            As a merchandising and publicity stunt, Musk said TBC sold 2,000 "flamethrowers" in 2018, 
            allegedly inspired by the Mel Brooks-directed film Spaceballs (1987). By late 2018, TBC had 
            active construction, approved plans in place, or an operational tunnel in Baltimore, Chicago, 
            and Los Angeles.
